                        MZ Cafe began as a dream to create a welcoming space where quality coffee and good conversation

                        establishment known for our signature drinks and authentic Filipino cuisine.

                    <h1>Our History</h1>
                    <hr class="Hr_Left">
                    <p> I, the owner of MZ cafe had been working in the industry for around 25 years.
                         But after resigning from my old job, I became a part-time barista in a local coffee shop.
                          From this experience, I was inspired to create my own business that is specifically aimed at serving students; this is because of my daughter, who is also a student.
                           Our menu items are affordable, wanting them to be budget friendly for younger customers of the cafe.
                            The MZ cafe is usually located near schools, because my daughter recommended me to do so, However, I wanted to expand from that and not rely solely on student customers. 
                    </p>
                    <p> MZ Cafe plans to expand its cafe branches near other schools, and, in addition; start providing delivery services.
                         We strive to establish a quality menu of food and beverages for customers other than just coffee, and create a cozy, community-driven atmosphere in our cafes, even if our cafes began to develop a more restaurant-styled shop.
                          I also wish to serve customers of all kinds, not just students, and want our cafe to be a welcoming place for customers to study, relax, or simply hang out with or without their friends.
